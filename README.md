# Encrypt-Decrypt
This tool can be used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information to be included in a will.

The idea with this tool is to store passwords like email, bank, LastPass on a memory stick, and give your loved ones the encryption key used to encrypt the document. 
If someone gain access to the encrypted document, they can't do anything without the encryption key. 
Your loved ones who have the encryption key won't have access to the encrypted document. The encrypted document should be stored in an emergency box. Your loved ones should know where this box is in case something happens to you.

The document should be a tab separated document with 2 columns. The first is a description which will stay plain text. The second will be encrypted.
